### Spawn for Minecraft 1.12.2 server from PastKNIGHT is an "old-school" spawn for Minecraft 1.12.2. I tried to stick to the style of Minecraft 1.5.2 servers. Because in me it is this style. Originally planned for my server. Continue your experience of the last RussianMine server(s) 1.5.2 - 1.7.2. But nothing happened. I recommend using the plugin on NPC merchants, I don't remember exactly what it's called. Spawn was built specifically for this plugin.
